# Introduction

Health insurance denials have been increasing in the upcoming years, with Senator Wiener introducing legislation to hold insurance companies Accountable, known as the Health Insurance Accountability Act (SB 363), for 2025-2056. There are several reasons why claims are denied, including not being covered by the insurance, requiring prior authorization, or the physician not being in the insurer's network. Think Global Health, a reliable online bulletin that provides forum in how "health influences and interacts with broader social, economic, and demographic trends." posted an article titled "Claim Denied: U.S. Insurnace and Health Equity", which stated that non-Hisptanic white patients are twice less likely to get their claims denied compared to other demographics and patients that make $30,000 or less per household has a 43% more likely to be denied.  

As this problem continues to persist, this project will focus on the main reason why Insurance Companies are denying the claims, how much money hospitals are potentially losing and hopefully, this can provide insights on what hospitals can do to reduce these claims. Since Healthcare claims data are hard to obtain, the dataset contains synthetic data, but the analysis and approach are the same. 

# Insights

 Overall Denial Rate & Financial Impact

  - Denial rate: 32.8%

  - Total projected financial loss: $98,069

Top Denial Reasons

  - Authorization Not Obtained: $13.64K loss

  - These two account for 29.5% of total losses

# Conclusion

As healthcare denial claims continue to increase, the data shows that there are actions that can reduce the denial claims. Insurance companies will always find ways to deny claims, but if we are meticulous with our approaches (by hiring/training more staff who are thorough with the process), the healthcare system will slowly improve, and this war can finally be over.
