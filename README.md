There are a variety reaons why claims are denied such as not being covered by the insurance, need prior authorization or the physican wasn't in the insurer's network. Think Global Health, a reliable online bulletin that provides forum in how "health influences and interacts with broader social, economic, and demographic trends." posted an article titled "Claim Denied: U.S. Insurnace and Health Equity", which stated that non-Hisptanic white patients are twice less likely to get their claims denied compared to other demographics and patients that make $30,000 or less per household has a 43% more likely to be denied.
