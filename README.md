# 🏥 Claims Denial Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction

Health insurance denials have been steadily increasing in recent years. In response, Senator Wiener introduced the **Health Insurance Accountability Act (SB 363)** (2025–2056) to improve transparency and accountability among insurance providers.

There are multiple reasons why claims get denied — including lack of coverage, missing prior authorizations, or providers being out-of-network. A recent article titled *“Claim Denied: U.S. Insurance and Health Equity”* (Think Global Health) noted that:
- **Non-Hispanic white patients are twice less likely** to have claims denied compared to other demographics.
- **Households earning $30,000 or less** are **43% more likely** to face denials.

Given these disparities and rising denial rates, this project investigates the **main causes of denials**, **financial losses incurred by hospitals**, and **actionable solutions** to reduce preventable denials. While the dataset is synthetic due to privacy concerns, the methodology and insights reflect real-world healthcare analytics practices.
